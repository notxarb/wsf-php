   have to use pdo_mysql extensions installed in your PHP. In windows you may need 'pdo' extension to be enabled with 
   pdo_mysql extension for proper operation.

How to Run Samples
==================
1. You should set the script directory in the wsf/php package root directory to your include_path directives of the php.ini. Please see the README.INSTALL or README.INSTALL_WIN32 for more details.
2. Set your database username password in the DB_USERNAME and DB_PASSWORD constants in a file called 'constants.php' and put it in to the same directory that the services are.
