<h1>WSO2 Web Services Framework/C</h1>
<p><a id="wsf_intro">WSO2 Web Services Framework/C (WSO2 WSF/C) is a
standards compliant, enterprise grade, open source, C library for providing
and consuming Web services in C. WSO2 WSF/C is a complete solution for
building and deploying Web services, and is the C library with the widest
range of WS-* specification implementations, including MTOM, WS-Addressing,
WS-Policy, WS-Security, WS-SecurityPolicy, WS-Reliable Messaging and
WS-eventing. It provides the best interoperability- all the Web services
specification implementations are tested for interoperability with Microsoft
.NET, WSO2 WSAS and other J2EE implementations.</a></p>

<p>WSO2 WSF/C is released with <a
href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache License
V2.0</a>, and is based on the family of <a
href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> open source projects, including <a
href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/c/">Apache Axis2/C</a>, <a
href="http://ws.apache.org/rampart/c/">Apache Rampart/C</a>, <a
href="http://ws.apache.org/sandesha/sandesha2/c/">Apache Sandesha2/C</a> and
<a href="http://ws.apache.org/savan/c/">Apache Savan/C</a>. The key advantage
of using WSO2 WSF/C is that it seamlessly integrates the multiple Apache
Axis2/C projects together, which is tested and ready to be used. It also
comes with additional features such as XMPP transport and a command line tool
for consuming Web services, named wsclient.</p>


<h2>Why Use WSO2 WSF/C?</h2>

<p>WSO2 WSF/C relives you of the burden of looking for and integrating
multiple software elements to build a comprehensive Web services stack. It
also provides you with the luxury of using a well tested software framework,
both for functionality as well as for interoperability, for embedding in your
C or C++ software stacks to enable the software Web services. Comprehensive
coverage of WS-* specifications allows you to use WSO2 WSF/C for enterprise
grade applications.</p>

<p>WSO2 WSF/C is an open source project. Thus you have all the benefits that
you can gain with an open source project, such as no worries of vendor
locking and support from the user community.</p>

<p>WSO2 WSF/C is ready to be embedded. This has been proven with WSO2
WSF/PHP, an open source PHP Web services extension based on WSO2 WSF/C.</p>
