  WSO2 Web Services Framework for C (WSO2 WSF/C)is a fully open source framework for

  SOAP, WSDL. REST as well as the Web Services specifications such as 
  WS-Addressing, MTOM, WS-Security and WS-Reliable Messaging. It comes with 
  both HTTP and XMPP transport support.

  WSO2 WSF/C is equipped with the wsclient tool that acts as a Web Service 
  client. wsclient can be given an XML payload as input, along with the service 
  endpoint and would output the the XML payload of the received reply. Various 
  options of wsclient allows the user to leverage the full Web services stack, 
  including WS-* specifications as well as raw REST like invocations.

  bindings could be built; WSO2 WSF/PHP, WSO2 WSF/RUBY are based on 
  WSO2 WSF/C. It could also be embeded in other software where the full
